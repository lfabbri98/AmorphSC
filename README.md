# Amorphous Semiconductors Analysis Library

This is a Python library created for my master thesis on amorphous semiconductors. It is composed by many files, each one to perform a different kind of analysis.

##Installation
To install simply write
'''
pip install AmorphSC
'''

## in_out.py

This is a file that contains functions dedicated to input and output. They are built on instruments I used in lab. However, it is very simple if ones would like to use different instruments. It's enough to modify the part in which column names are given since output files from different intruments will be different. 

Here you can also find functions called **s** that can print any number in scientific notation.
